## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Design Decisions
- **Database:** Using Laravel migrations for version control
- **Authentication:** Enhanced Laravel Auth with role-based access
- **Frontend:** Bootstrap 5 with custom CSS
- **API:** Laravel Sanctum for API authentication
- **Testing:** PHPUnit with Feature and Unit tests

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Refactor existing controllers after Phase 1
- [ ] Optimize database queries after implementation
- [ ] Update frontend assets after basic functionality

### Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Data loss during migration
  - **Mitigation:** Complete database backup before changes
- **Risk:** User experience disruption
  - **Mitigation:** Phased rollout with rollback capability
- **Risk:** Performance issues
  - **Mitigation:** Load testing and optimization in Phase 4
